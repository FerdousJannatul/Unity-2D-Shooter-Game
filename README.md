# Unity-2D-Shooter-Game
This is a 2D target shooting game made in Unity using C# language.
Each target appears at random locations for two seconds, and if you can hit the target within those two seconds then the score increases by 1. If you reach a score of 10, you win the game and the game stops playing after displaying a winning message. The score is displayed throughout the whole game and it uses UI Text feature for the display. The game also has audio effects, making a shooting sound each time a target is shot.
